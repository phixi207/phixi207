12/7/2023 - Programmer = 0
Learning Python as a first language at 29 years old, in a random and risky career change move. Let's see this go up in flames.
Goals: 
1. Stay focused, and actually learn the subject matter, not just how to do it. Rather, why it works in the first place.
2. Find a healthy pace and stick to it. Don't allow for interuptions to take place.
3. Create something useful, if not humorous; boxed as one.
4. Decide which areas of programming I find to be the most interesting.
   A. Game Development - An area of consideration. Tickles my fancy.
   B. Machine Learning - A new interest. Seemingly endlessly complex by nature.
   C. TBA
